This package provides tools for the study of the asymptotic behavior of
the sequence of coefficients of rational generating functions in
several variables along a given direction.

The public interface of our toolbox is provided by the following
functions and classes:

- :func:`.diagonal_asymptotics_combinatorial` -- the central function of the package,
- :func:`.get_expansion_terms` -- helper function for extracting
  the terms in the output expansion with more structure,
- :func:`.contributing_points_combinatorial` -- computes all contributing
  points of a combinatorial multivariate rational function,
- :func:`.minimal_critical_points_combinatorial` -- computes all non-zero minimal
  critical points of a combinatorial multivariate rational function,
- :func:`.critical_points` -- compute all critical points of a combinatorial
  multivariate rational function,
- :class:`.ACSVSettings` -- a class for managing several package-global
  settings (like the default output format for :func:`.diagonal_asymptotics_combinatorial`,
  or the backend used for Gröbner basis computations).


Quickstart
==========

The easiest way to install the latest released version of the package
is via PyPI simply by running

.. code-block:: bash

   sage -pip install sage-acsv

or, alternatively, executing a cell containing

::

   %pip install sage-acsv

in a SageMath Jupyter notebook.

The package can be run in an interactive environment in the browser
using `Binder <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ACSVMath/sage_acsv/HEAD>`__.
See the :doc:`collection of examples <examples>` for a brief tour of
the capabilities of this package.

An article serving as an introduction to version 0.1.0 of the package
and its internals can be found at [SageACSV23]_.


Reference Manual
================

All public-facing functions and classes in our package are documented
in our :doc:`reference manual <reference>`.
